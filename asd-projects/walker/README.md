# 🚶‍♂️ Box Walker

Control a box with your arrow keys! It might seem simple, but this project will deepen your understanding of animation, keyboard input, and object-based game logic.

You’ll take what you learned in **Bouncing Box** and level it up by:

- Responding to real-time keyboard events
- Tracking and updating position using an object
- Moving and drawing with jQuery
- Adding game rules like screen boundaries
- Laying the groundwork for more interactive games

Whether you’re aiming to create your first multiplayer experience, explore tag mechanics, or build your own arcade-style game — this is where it starts.

🕹️ Time to move!

# Overview

In this project we will be building a simple program that allows us to control the movement of a box with the arrow keys. As a challenge, try limiting the movement of the "walker" to the boundaries of the board. Then, add a second "walker" and turn the program into a game of tag!

## Learning Objectives

- Become familiar with the template repository
- Apply lesson on detecting keyboard inputs
- Make connections to the Bouncing Box program and recognize patterns
- Continue to practice using jQuery

## Push Reminder

To push to GitHub, enter the following commands in bash:

## **TODO 1: Update the Box ID and Style**

🎯 **Goal:** Rename the box in your HTML to `walker` and customize its appearance with CSS.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Update the HTML ID**

   - Open `index.html`.
   - Find the line that creates the game box:
     ```html
     <div id="gameItem"></div>
     ```
   - Change the `id` from `gameItem` to `walker`.

2. **Update the CSS Styles**
   - Open `style.css`.
   - Either modify the existing `#gameItem` styles, or create a new rule for `#walker`:
     ```css
     #walker {
       width: 50px;
       height: 50px;
       background-color: green;
     }
     ```
   - 🎨 Try customizing the walker’s color, size, or shape to make it unique!

      <strong>🔗 Matching IDs:</strong> The <code>id</code> you set in HTML must match the CSS selector used to apply styles. For example, an element with <code>id="walker"</code> should be styled using <code>#walker</code> in your CSS.<br><br>
      <strong>🎨 Custom Styling:</strong> CSS allows you to change the walker’s size, color, and shape. Get creative and give your walker a unique appearance!<br><br>
      <strong>💡 jQuery is Coming:</strong> In future steps, you’ll begin using <code>jQuery</code> to select and modify HTML elements using their IDs — just like in CSS. For example:  
      <code>$("#walker")</code> selects the same element that <code>#walker</code> styles in CSS.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

<br>

### ✅ **Check Your Work!**

- Your walker should now appear on the screen with your custom style.
- If the walker disappears:
  - Check that the ID in your HTML matches the selector in your CSS (`#walker`)
  - Make sure your style changes were saved

## **TODO 2: Register Keyboard Inputs**

🎯 **Goal:** Set up an event listener that runs a function whenever a key is pressed on the keyboard.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Find the Setup Code**

   - 🔍 Open `index.js`.
   - Locate the **SETUP** section where jQuery is used to listen for events with this pattern:
     ```js
     $(document).on("...", handleEvent);
     ```

2. **Update the Event Type**

   - Replace the event type with `"keydown"` so that it listens for key presses.

3. **Update the Handler Function Name**

   - Replace `handleEvent` with a new function name: `handleKeyDown`.
   - This is the function that will run when a key is pressed.

4. **Rename the Function**

   - Find the existing `handleEvent` function definition in the **CORE LOGIC** section.
   - Change the function name to `handleKeyDown`.

5. **Log the Key Code**
   - Inside `handleKeyDown`, use `console.log()` to print the numeric key code:
     ```js
     console.log(event.which);
     ```
   - This will help you confirm that key presses are being registered correctly.

      <strong>🧪 Console Logging:</strong> Always log values you don’t understand! Use <code>console.log(event.which)</code> to confirm your handler is working correctly.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

<br>

### ✅ **Check Your Work!**

- Preview your game using **Live Server**, then open your browser’s **Console**.
- Press keys and make sure numeric codes (like `37`, `38`, `40`, or `87`) show up in the console.
- If nothing appears:
  - Double-check that your event type is `"keydown"`
  - Make sure the handler function is named `handleKeyDown` and used in both places

## **TODO 3: React to Specific Keys**

🎯 **Goal:** Create a `KEY` object to store key codes and use `if` statements to react to arrow key presses.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create a `KEY` Object**

   - 🔍 In the **SETUP** section of `index.js`, create a constant called `KEY` that maps key names (like `LEFT`, `UP`, `RIGHT`, `DOWN`) to their numeric key codes.
   - We'll give you the code for the **Enter** key, but you'll need to figure out the others on your own:
     ```js
     const KEY = {
       ENTER: 13,
       LEFT: ___,
       UP: ___,
       RIGHT: ___,
       DOWN: ___,
     };
     ```
   - 💡 Use the console from the last TODO or visit [keycode.info](https://keycode.info) to identify the correct values.

2. **Update `handleKeyDown`**

   - Inside the `handleKeyDown` function, write a series of `if` statements that respond to each arrow key.
   - Example:
     ```js
     if (event.which === KEY.LEFT) {
       console.log("left pressed");
     }
     ```
   - Repeat for `KEY.UP`, `KEY.RIGHT`, and `KEY.DOWN`.

3. **Test Your Key Bindings**
   - Open the console and press each arrow key.
   - You should see the appropriate direction printed for each one.

- Press each arrow key. You should see:
  - `"left pressed"` for ←
  - `"up pressed"` for ↑
  - `"right pressed"` for →
  - `"down pressed"` for ↓
- If not:
  - Check your `KEY` values and spelling
  - Confirm your `if` statements are using `event.which`

## **TODO 4: Declare `walker` Variable**

🎯 **Goal:** Create an object to store the walker's position and speed on the screen.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create a Global `walker` Variable**

   - 🔍 Scroll to the **SETUP** section in `index.js`.
   - Declare a variable named `walker`.

2. **Assign an Object to `walker`**

   - The `walker` variable should store an object.
   - This object will represent the current state of your game character and should include the following properties:
     - `x` — horizontal position (left/right)
     - `y` — vertical position (up/down)
     - `speedX` — horizontal speed
     - `speedY` — vertical speed

3. **Initialize All Values to `0`**
   - Each property in the object should start with a value of `0`.
   - ✅ If you’re not sure about syntax, think back to how objects were created in the data shapes project.

      <strong>💨 <code>speedX</code> and <code>speedY</code>:</strong> These represent how much to change the walker’s position on each update. They will eventually be adjusted by keyboard input.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

<br>

### ✅ **Check Your Work!**

- Make sure you’ve declared a global variable called `walker` and assigned it an object with **four properties**: `x`, `y`, `speedX`, and `speedY`.
- Each of these should start with a value of `0`.
- Your program won’t crash yet if this is missing — but future steps **depend** on this structure being present and correct.

<!-- 4 line breaks between TODOs -->

<br><br><br><br>

## **TODO 5: Update the Walker's Position in Code**

🎯 **Goal:** Write a helper function that updates the walker’s location based on its current speed.

      <code>positionX = positionX + speed;</code><br><br>
      That worked because each value was stored in its own variable.<br><br>
      In this project, we’re storing all of that data in a single object called <code>walker</code>.<br><br>
      So instead of <code>positionX</code>, we now update <code>walker.x</code>.<br>
      And instead of <code>speed</code>, we use <code>walker.speedX</code>.<br><br>
      🧠 It’s the same pattern — we’re just working inside an object.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Define the Function**

   - 🔍 Scroll to the **HELPER FUNCTIONS** section in `index.js`.
   - Create a function called `repositionGameItem()`.

2. **Update the Walker’s `x` and `y` Properties**

   - Inside your function, add the horizontal speed to the x-position.
   - Then add the vertical speed to the y-position.
   - Be sure to use **dot notation** to update both values within the `walker` object.

3. **Call the Function from `newFrame`**
   - Inside the `newFrame` function, call `repositionGameItem()` so that the position updates continuously as the game runs.

<br>

### ✅ **Check Your Work!**

- You should now have:
  - A new function called `repositionGameItem()`
  - A call to that function inside `newFrame()`
- Try temporarily assigning a number to `walker.speedX` or `walker.speedY` and use:
  ```js
  console.log(walker.x, walker.y);
  ```
  to check if the values are changing correctly each frame.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Define the `redrawGameItem()` Function**

   - 🔍 In the **HELPER FUNCTIONS** section of `index.js`, create a new function named `redrawGameItem()`.

2. **Use jQuery to Draw the Walker**

   - Inside your function, use jQuery’s `.css()` method to update the position of the walker element:
     - Use the `"left"` CSS property to set the horizontal (x) position.
     - Use the `"top"` CSS property to set the vertical (y) position.
   - You’ll need to use the values stored in the `walker` object’s `x` and `y` properties.

3. **Call the Function from `newFrame()`**
   - At the bottom of the `newFrame()` function (after `repositionGameItem()`), call `redrawGameItem()`.

## **TODO 7: Update Speed When Arrow Keys Are Pressed**

🎯 **Goal:** Change the walker’s speed when the player presses an arrow key so it starts moving in that direction.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Edit the `handleKeyDown` Function**

   - 🔍 Scroll to your `handleKeyDown` function in the CORE LOGIC section of `index.js`.

2. **Set Speed for Arrow Keys**

   - Use `if` statements to check which arrow key was pressed.
   - When the LEFT arrow is pressed, update `walker.speedX` to `-5` to move left.
   - 🔄 Use your understanding from Bouncing Box and earlier TODOs to handle the other three arrow keys yourself.

3. **Test Movement**
   - Open your project with Live Server and press an arrow key.
   - You should see the walker begin to move in that direction.
   - Try refreshing the page between tests — the walker will continue moving after the first key press unless you reset the speed manually.

### ✅ **Check Your Work!**

- Open your Live Server preview and press the arrow keys one at a time.
- The walker should move in the correct direction.
- **Refresh between tests** — your speed is not reset unless you manually set it back to `0`.
- Ask yourself:
  - Do all four directions work?
  - Do you understand why diagonal movement occurs if you press two keys in a row?

<br><br><br><br>

## **TODO 8: Stop the Walker on Key Release**

🎯 **Goal:** Use a new event listener to reset the walker’s speed when a key is released.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Register a New Event Listener**

   - 🔍 Scroll to the SETUP section of your code.
   - Add another line to register a second key event — this one should listen for `"keyup"` events.
   - Just like `"keydown"`, you’ll need to write:
     - **what** event you're listening for (`"keyup"`),
     - and **what function** should handle it (e.g., `handleKeyUp`).
   - ✅ Make sure this line matches the structure of your existing `"keydown"` registration — but don’t reuse the same handler function!

2. **Create the `handleKeyUp()` Function**

   - 🔍 Add a new function below `handleKeyDown()` and name it `handleKeyUp`.
   - Make sure to include the `event` parameter in the function definition.
   - Inside the function:
     - Use `if` statements to check if the released key is one of the arrow keys.
     - Set the appropriate speed property (either `speedX` or `speedY`) to `0` based on which key was released.

3. **Test Each Key**
   - Open your game in Live Server.
   - Try holding down the arrow keys, then releasing them.
   - The walker should **start moving** when a key is pressed, and **stop** when the key is released.

### ✅ **Check Your Work!**

- Try holding down and releasing each arrow key.
- The walker should:
  - Start moving when the key is pressed,
  - Stop moving when the key is released.
- Refresh your game and test each direction again to make sure both speed values are reset.

## **TODO 9: Prevent the Walker from Leaving the Board**

🎯 **Goal:** Stop the walker from leaving the visible game board by creating a boundary detection function.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create a Helper Function**

   - 🔍 In the HELPER FUNCTIONS section, create a function named `wallCollision()`.

2. **Write Boundary Conditions**

   - Inside the `wallCollision()` function:
     - Use `if` statements to check if the `walker` object is moving the object beyond the game board edges.
     - Recall that the walker’s `x` and `y` properties represent its position on the screen.
     - Use `0` as the minimum (left/top) value for each direction.
     - Use `$("#board").width()` for the maximum horizontal boundary, and `$("#board").height()` for the maximum vertical boundary.
     - If a boundary is crossed, subtract the walker’s speed in that direction to "undo" the movement.

3. **Call the Function in `newFrame()`**
   - Inside your `newFrame()` function:
     - Call `wallCollision()` after `repositionGameItem()`, but before `redrawGameItem()`.

      <strong>🧱 Borders of the Game Board:</strong><br>
      - The left and top borders are at <code>0</code>.<br>
      - The right border is <code>$("#board").width()</code>.<br>
      - The bottom border is <code>$("#board").height()</code>.<br><br>
      <strong>🚫 Preventing Escape:</strong><br>
      Instead of reversing the speed (which would cause bouncing), "undo" the last movement by subtracting the speed:<br>
      <code>walker.x -= walker.speedX;</code><br>
      <code>walker.y -= walker.speedY;</code><br><br>
      <strong>📐 Make sure:</strong><br>
      You are checking <em>both</em> edges on each axis: left/right for x, top/bottom for y.

### ✅ **Check Your Work!**

- Open Live Server and try moving the walker in all directions.
- Confirm the walker:
  - **Stops** at the left, right, top, and bottom edges of the board.
  - No longer escapes off-screen or gets stuck.
- If the walker bounces back or jitters at the edge, revisit the logic for "undoing" movement (don't reverse speed).

## 🌟 Extra Challenges

These challenges are optional — but they’ll push your coding skills further and help you become more comfortable with JavaScript game logic. Try them out if you finish early or want to extend your project!

---

### 🧍 Add a Second Player Controlled with WASD

- Create a new walker object with its own position and speed properties.
- Register a new set of keys (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`) in your `KEY` object.
- Create a second set of event handlers and movement logic.
- Can both players move independently? How will you keep track of their positions?

---

### 🎨 Make the Player(s) Change Color on Click

Use jQuery’s `.css()` function and an event listener to change a walker’s color when it is clicked.

To generate a random color, you can use:

```js
var randomColor = "#000000".replace(/0/g, function () {
  return (~~(Math.random() * 16)).toString(16);
});
```

> 🔎 Not a fan of that one-liner? Try experimenting with simpler random RGB values!

---

### 🏷️ Create a “Tag” Game with Collision Detection

- Detect when the two players overlap on the board.
- Use conditional logic to detect collision (hint: compare their `x` and `y` positions).
- Make the "it" player turn red when tagging the other.
- Add game reset logic and tweak player speeds to create balance.

> 💡 Want to go even further? Add scorekeeping, countdown timers, or a shrinking playfield!
